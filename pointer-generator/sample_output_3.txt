argue , i was able to get lte speed with other cell phone with the same service provider -rrb- and also network drops and gets back again , this never happened with my age old android phone i almost bought the nexus __5x__ , but then i saw you could update this to android 6 oh __btw__ , update to android 6 before you activate a service __plan7__ and could not be happier ! snappy fast , clear display , basically stock android so none of that samsung __bloat__ ware you ca n't __removeandroid__ goes a little awkward , sometimes it crashes and most of the time __overheats__ out of nothing it wo n't record phone calls with android 6 also features an update to android marshmallow , available as soon as you turn on the phone it is packed to the brim with features , has a very modern android -lrb- it updated to __6pros__ : super __lightgreat__ stereo __speakershad__ the latest __androidpicks__ up all t-mobile __bandsstylish__ design - sleek and __beautifulcons__ : camera is __badandroid__

little __laggy__ at times , but that is compared to almost stock android on the moto gin fairness , some of the things i do n't like i suspect are just my own fault for not learning android __5/lollipop__ completely yet - and maybe a lot of stuff i just really hate about lollipop the near stock android user interface was nice and smooth with some lag when opening up new __applicationsthe__ phone was a bit __laggy__ and had its problems , but hey you ca n't complain for $ 250 ! however , the lack of support was truly shameful , we were stuck in android __5late__ edit : after upgrading to android marshmallow problems __1,2__ and 4 went __awayusabilityandroid__ lollipop comes standard -lrb- i think i had 5 an android phone that wo n't allow google voice to function properly is simply unacceptable a phone with the android os was my preferred choice pure android for most of the part it is a little different going from android 4 to android 5 some little __nitpicky__ things i do n't like , and this is just me , and this is on any non pure android phone , i do n't like __am/pm__ showing on the lock screen - it just looks off centered all __androids__ have weak and strong points , but not including the nexus , most of them have a lot more dumb __oem__ __annoyances__ that you have to deal with , but i __digress__ that 's pretty crazy in android __worldvery__ __customizable__ and near stock android __lollipopthe__ stock __alcatel__ android set-up needs a little maturing for my tastes , so i installed nova launcher and am using a lock screen option android : i believe sometime after getting this phone , android made it so that apps could only be stored on an sd card if you 're looking for an android phone with a reliable gps unit , this unit should do a fine job for __youandroid__ __6i__ __havethis__ phone about a month , and restart only once but most phones are fragile in my __opinion!one__ other thing to consider is that this phone runs on android 6 the nexus 4 proves this is plenty to run android __smoothlyall__ in all , i think this is a no-brainer for anyone looking for a new android phone with a large screen still __relearning__ android phones after years with a windows __phonenow__ i notice the price has gone down since we bought it , so anybody who wants an android phone at 5 '' or bigger has no reason to ignore this this phone has been updated to android 6 this is loaded with android 6 almost stock android is a delight to use , at first i was so dumbfounded on how much less i had to do to set up the device , which caused me to stare at it and wonder what __esle__ to do nearly pure version of android __lollipopafter__ my nexus 5 screen shattered i was not happy with the state of any of the higher end android __phonessoftware__ : the phone comes with almost stock android it 's sharp , __hi-res__ , great colors , and the __gui__ and near stock android experience makes the experience that much better -lrb- unlike samsung or other phones where they have great screens but the __gui__ ruins the premium feel -rrb- __win7__ , __win8__ , linux , other android , and fire platforms all handled this with no problem this thing gets the job done for me running on android 6 the camera is also very very poor compared to an iphone and even some other __androidsx__ android or another os , you wo n't have the small gripes that i have after a few android updates runs extremely slow runs android lollipop , so it 's basically top tier no issues with the phone so far , or negatives other than the lack of a silencing option -lrb- also look up this bug on android lollipop for any phone you 're looking at -rrb- never had a need for anti-virus scanner on android yet so it was the first thing i trashed i think this is more to do with lollipop than __alcatel__ because my other android devices also were a little buggy after __ota__ updates to lollipop until i completed a factory reset almost stock __androidthere__ are an awful lot of __androids__ out there , plus other phones built on differing operating platforms i 've been doing that for years with my old android google apps seem to work just a little bit better on android , although that should n't be a surprise i do n't particularly like where android puts all it 's system settings , but that 's a personal __nit__ since i 'm still __acclimating__ to the android regardless whether i let android automatically detect network or i manually choose any of the 3 discovered __metropcs__ networks , i receive error the `` sim card not permitted to connect '' to __networkpdf__ says all you need to do is __plop__ in the sim , your micro flash and let android do the __restthe__ thing is android os has many languages available on its root , yet __alcatel__ purposely disabled the rest of the languages and made them unavailable i am still trying to adapt to the new version of android and how the phone it self __workspair__ that with the fact that this phone rarely gets patches and will likely never be updated to android 66 -rrb- near stock __androidfor__ you hardcore __phone-o-files__ , its basically a no frills new android os and the no frills means no __bloatware__ , fast __load/response__ times and a solid day on the battery usage close to stock android i changed the phone 's supplied launcher to the google launcher and that gave the unit even more of a stock android __feeli__ know android can do some funky things , so i waited about ten minutes to see if the information would show up on the screen and it had n't changed , so i __rebooted__ the phone again i hardly call that a small bug , and looking around some developer forums , it does n't seem to be a bug tied to android 5 as with any android phone __customization__ is really limitless so i wo n't spend time on that __herecons__ : like to pocket dial a lot but i heard android is famous for that with emergency calling it is fairly close to a stock android experience well im not really a swing vote on android vs apple , but this phone in my opinion is equivalent to the iphone 6 , same size , same camera , same speed there is no real __bloatware__ other than all of the google apps , and the launcher is clean and very close to pure android there is a software update that brings android 6 __ugh__ , i think that might be an android issue __though0__ android experience with an icon pack install with the __acatel__ launcher aside from the icons , this phone is basically pure android the operating system is close to vanilla android with very little changes - near stock android __lollipopto__ __preface__ this review : i am coming from a nexus 4 , which had served me well up till the most recent android updates , which have been buggy and have killed the battery life on what was previously an almost perfect __devicethe__ android 5 seriously guys it 's standard on android to have the volume and power button on the right __sidei__ 've had similar android phones and never had this __issue5__ screen android phone why buy samsung or apple for three times the price another plus was that __alcatel__ did provide a software
