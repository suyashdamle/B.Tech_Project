:ARTICLE:  -lrb- cnn -rrb- the palestinian authority officially became the __123rd__ member of the international criminal court on wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories . the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at the hague , in the netherlands , where the court is based . the palestinians signed the icc 's founding rome statute in january , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed `` in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem , since june 13 , 2014 . '' later that month , the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis . as members of the court , palestinians may be subject to __counter-charges__ as well . israel and the united states , neither of which is an icc member , opposed the palestinians ' efforts to join the body . but palestinian foreign minister riad __al-malki__ , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an icc news release . `` indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' judge __kuniko__ __ozaki__ , a vice president of the icc , said __acceding__ to the treaty was just the first step for the palestinians . `` as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine , palestine __acquires__ all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute . these are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . rights group human rights watch welcomed the development . `` governments seeking to __penalize__ palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said __balkees__ __jarrah__ , international justice counsel for the group . `` what 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' in january , when the preliminary icc examination was opened , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was __overstepping__ its boundaries . the united states also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc , '' the state department said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` palestine . '' while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . prosecutor __fatou__ __bensouda__ said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality . '' the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june . the international criminal court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . cnn 's __vasco__ __cotovio__ , kareem khadder and faith karimi contributed to this report .

INFO:tensorflow:ARTICLE:  -lrb- cnn -rrb- governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions , amnesty international alleges in its annual report on the death penalty . `` the dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year , '' said __salil__ shetty , amnesty 's secretary general in a release . `` it is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people 's lives -- putting people to death for ` terrorism ' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence . '' the report , `` death sentences and executions 2014 , '' cites the example of pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in peshawar in december . china is also mentioned , as having used the death penalty as a tool in its `` strike hard '' campaign against terrorism in the restive __far-western__ province of xinjiang . the annual report __catalogs__ the use of __state-sanctioned__ killing as a punitive measure across the globe , and this year 's edition contains some mixed findings . on one hand , the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22 % on the previous year . at least __607__ people were executed around the world in 2014 , compared to __778__ in 2013 . amnesty 's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in china , where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret . belarus and vietnam , too , do not release data on death penalty cases . `` the long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions -lrb- worldwide -rrb- , '' audrey __gaughran__ , amnesty 's director of global issues , told cnn . `` a number of countries are closer to abolition , and there are some signs that some countries will be __abolitionist__ by 2015 . -lrb- there are -rrb- signals of a world that is nearing abolition . '' while the report notes some encouraging signs , it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014 . at least __2,466__ people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year , an increase of 28 % compared with 2013 . the report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to __mass-sentencing__ in countries including egypt and nigeria , `` against scores of people in some cases . '' the organization found `` positive developments '' worldwide , with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions . opinion : sharp spike in death sentences . sub-saharan africa , for example , saw a 28 % fall in reported cases , and executions recorded in the middle east and north africa were down 23 % compared to 2013 . `` even though we 've highlighted some of the negative developments ... i think we would always highlight that there are positive developments , '' __gaughran__ said . `` across the board , with the exception of europe and central asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region . '' the resumption of the use of capital punishment in belarus -- the only country in europe and central asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an __near-universal__ decrease in countries using the death penalty by region . the united states has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the americas to conduct executions , but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly , from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014 . the state of washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year . the u.s. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment , with only iran -lrb- 289 + -rrb- , iraq -lrb- 61 + -rrb- , and saudi arabia -lrb- 90 + -rrb- executing more people in 2014 . while figures are not available , amnesty estimates that china also executes `` thousands '' of prisoners each year , `` more than the rest of the world put together . '' the report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death . `` in the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed , the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards , '' the report stated . `` in 2014 amnesty international raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in afghanistan , bangladesh , china , egypt , iran , iraq , north korea , pakistan , saudi arabia and sri lanka . '' the united nations secretary-general , ban ki-moon , last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment . `` the taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another , '' he said , in marking world day against death penalty in october . `` we must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights . '' amnesty estimates that at least __19,094__ people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014 .
