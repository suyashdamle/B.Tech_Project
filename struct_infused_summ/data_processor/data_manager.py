    Functionality:
        In this file, our goal is to manage the format of data in different level
        
        Assume that all the document are pre-processed as format below:
            lower letters:
                all words are forced to be lowercase
            unknown words:
                using a symbol <unk> to represent the unknown words
            number pattern:
                #.# for numbers like 1.5
                ### for number like 123
                ...
            no </s> in the text
        
        
    Word level:
        Word(string)
        Index
        Embedding
    Sentence level:
        Sentence(string)
        sequence of Word(string)
        sequence of Word Index
        Embedding matrix
    Document level:
        Document(string)
        sequence of Sentence(string)
        sequence of sequence of Word(string)
        sequence of sequence of Word Index
        Embedding matrix (add sentence boundary at the end)
